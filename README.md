# Telegram-for-Christian
This is a unofficial Telegram client which adds some extra features to official Telegram:
- Rings when a group call is started by the group manager so users will not miss group calls.

To success build, you should apply for your own Telegram API app id and Firebase Project contains two app with application IDs org.telegram.christian and org.telegram.christian.beta.
That's all, welcome PRs and issues.
