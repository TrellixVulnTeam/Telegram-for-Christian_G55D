This is a unofficial Telegram client which adds some extra features to official Telegram:
- Rings when a group call is started by the group manager so users will not miss group calls.
- Support 10 accounts at most.
- Add Indonesian, Hindi, Tamil, Vietnamese, Russian, and Simplified Chinese as built-in languages.
